# Java Socket Programming Based Chat System

## Project Description
Java Socket Programming Based Chat System is a TCP-based client–server application developed using Java Socket programming.  
The system enables text-based communication between a client and a server using blocking input/output streams.

This project demonstrates core networking concepts such as client–server architecture, TCP communication, and socket-based data exchange in Java.
